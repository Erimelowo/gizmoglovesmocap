## **How to build:**
I have cut some slit of the glove to waive the flexsensor trough.

## Wiring is easy just solder wires to all of the same side of the flex sensor. And the other site to the Feather pins

## Put the resistances on one side of the Featherv2 and solder all of them together. Solder a wire on the 3v to the joint resistances

## And solder the wires to the other side in that order:
A9: Thumb
A7: Index
A2: Middle
A3: Ring
A4: Little
